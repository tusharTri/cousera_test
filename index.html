				<p>My last made me feel like I would never try again
				But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
				Come closer, I'll give you all my love
				If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
				My last made me feel like I would never try again
				But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
				Come closer, I'll give you all my love
				If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything</p>

				<p>Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need you
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown the pain by pouring up
Speeding fast on the run, never want to get caught up
Now you the one that I'm calling
Swore that I'd never forget, don't think I'm just talking
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya baby</p></div>

				<h2 id="third">Para 3</h2>
				<p>My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything</p>
